They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, and some martial arts disciplines.","Pushups are a simple and effective bodyweight movement that can help increase strength in your upper body and core.","https://static.strengthlevel.com/images/illustrations/push-ups-1-1000x1000.jpg");
